Simple custom moodule with a node for logging purpose. You need to set the log level (info, error,debug) and the message in the Node. The message might also contain CognigyScript.

Furthermore, we included an experimental feature without any guaranty for logging directly to your browser console using a WebBrowser. You can usually access the console via F12 (Developer Tools). Please note, the message for direct browser logging can be either a JSON-object (i.e. {{JSON.stringify(ci)}}) or a string in quotes (you have to set the quotes here like "Hello World").
